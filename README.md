# Mega-auto-import
Auto-import a folder after any updates from this folder, to upload it in Mega.nz

##
This code will authenticate to your Mega.nz account using your email and password, create a folder with the specified name, and then iterate through all the files in the "Recherche Master" folder on your local storage and upload them to the Mega.nz folder.

Note that the mega.py library provides many other functions that you can use to access and manipulate your Mega.nz account, such as downloading files, deleting files, and moving files between folders. You can find more information about these functions in the library's documentation.
